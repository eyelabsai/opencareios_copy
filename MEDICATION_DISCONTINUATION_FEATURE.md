# Medication Discontinuation Feature

## Overview
The health assistant now supports automatic medication discontinuation when users mention stopping or discontinuing medications in their messages. This feature allows users to naturally communicate their medication changes through conversation, and the system will automatically process these actions.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interaction
Users can tell the health assistant they want to stop taking a medication using natural language:
- "I want to stop taking my blood pressure medication"
- "I no longer need my allergy medication"
- "Please discontinue my Lisinopril"
- "I stopped taking my antibiotic"

### 2. AI Detection
The health assistant AI analyzes the user's message and detects medication stop/discontinue actions using patterns like:
- "stop taking [medication]"
- "discontinue [medication]"
- "no longer taking [medication]"
- "stopped [medication]"
- "quit [medication]"
- "don't need [medication] anymore"
- "can stop [medication]"
- "should stop [medication]"

### 3. Medication Matching
The system uses flexible matching to find the correct medication:
- Exact name matches
- Partial name matches
- Category-based matching (e.g., "blood pressure medication" matches Lisinopril, Amlodipine, etc.)
- Brand name vs generic name matching

### 4. Automatic Processing
When a medication stop action is detected:
1. The system finds the matching active medication
2. Marks it as discontinued with the current date
3. Records the reason for discontinuation
4. Moves it to the discontinued medications list
5. Shows a confirmation message to the user

## Technical Implementation

### Server-Side (OpenCare/api/health-assistant.js)
- Enhanced AI prompt to detect medication actions
- JSON response format with medication actions
- Flexible medication name matching

### iOS App (opencareai/)
- Updated `HealthAssistantResponse` model to include medication actions
- Enhanced `HealthAssistantViewModel` to process medication actions
- Added medication matching logic with logging
- User notification system for action confirmations

### Database Changes
- Medications are marked as inactive (`isActive: false`)
- Discontinuation date is recorded
- Discontinuation reason is stored
- Medication actions are logged in `visit_medications` collection

## User Experience

### Suggested Questions
The health assistant now includes suggested questions that demonstrate the feature:
- "I want to stop taking my blood pressure medication"
- "I no longer need my allergy medication"

### Notifications
Users receive clear feedback when medication actions are processed:
- Success messages: "✅ Discontinued [Medication Name]"
- Warning messages: "⚠️ Could not find medication to discontinue: [Medication Name]"
- Error messages for processing failures

## Benefits

1. **Natural Interaction**: Users can communicate medication changes in their own words
2. **Automatic Processing**: No need to manually navigate to medication settings
3. **Audit Trail**: All medication actions are logged with reasons and dates
4. **Flexible Matching**: Handles various ways users might refer to their medications
5. **User Feedback**: Clear confirmation of actions taken

## Future Enhancements

1. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Ask users to confirm before discontinuing medications
2. **Batch Actions**: Handle multiple medication changes in one message
3. **Medication History**: Show users their medication change history
4. **Integration with Visit Records**: Link medication changes to specific visits
5. **Advanced Matching**: Support for more medication categories and synonyms

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Open the Health Assistant in the iOS app
2. Ask to stop taking a medication you're currently prescribed
3. Verify the medication appears in your discontinued medications list
4. Check that the discontinuation date and reason are recorded correctly

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Medication not found: Shows warning message
- Processing failures: Shows error message
- Network issues: Graceful degradation
- Invalid medication names: Logs for debugging
